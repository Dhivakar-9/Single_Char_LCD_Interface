# Single_Char_LCD_Interface
This project demonstrates interfacing a 16x2 alphanumeric LCD with the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller, programmed in Embedded C using Keil µVision IDE. The LCD is configured in 8-bit mode, where data lines are connected to Port 0 and control signals RS and E are used to differentiate between command and data operations. The program initializes the LCD and displays the character ‘A’ on the screen. This project helps beginners understand LCD initialization, command execution, and data display using GPIO in ARM7 microcontrollers.
